This repository includes slides and notes from "Sea Level Rise and Coastal Geotechnics" (EAS/CEE 4803/8803) at Georgia Tech, a combined undergrad/grad course on sea level science and coastal engineering design practice using sea level information. This course was co-taught by Profs. Alexander Robel (EAS) and Jorge Macedo (CEE). Many of the original slide sets are too large to host on GitHub, so reduced resolution PDFs have been uploaded here instead. Original PDFs, keynote and powerpoint slide decks are available upon request.
